                <p >When I was a child, I experienced being left by my mom because she went abroad and left <br> me with my grandparents until I turned 10. I went through a lot as a child, even though my <br> mom went abroad to support us and meet our everyday needs. However, it still wasn't enough. <br>So, at the age of 10, I would go to the sea every morning and night to help my grandparents catch fish.</p> <br>

                 <p>I wasn’t expecting that adulting would be this hard and tough. <br> I’ve realized a lot of things that I thought I wouldn’t. I’ve learned to <br> stay firm and strong and overcome every challenge that the world throws at me. <br>I know that I’m still far from where I thought I would be, but I’m getting closer.</p>
